## Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements of an array/list in a specific order.  

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of an algorithm as the input size tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O notation is one of the most fundamental tools for computer scientists to analyze the cost of an algorithm.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## C, Algorithm, Data structure

1. Task 0 (**Bubble sort**). compile
   with `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble`
2. Task 1 (**Insertion sort**) compile
   with ` gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 1-main.c 1-insertion_sort_list.c print_list.c -o insertion`
3. Task 2 (**Selection sort**)

4. Task 3 (**Quick sort**)
